# First Boot Camp Challenge- Code Refractor Horiseon

## Description 

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency ensuring all people, including users with disabilities, are able to access our website is highly important to our brand
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards, allowing users access our website easily with assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines such as google.
```

### Acceptance Criteria

* Semantic HTML elements found throughout the original source code are inserted
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
* Application deployed at live URL
* Deployed application implements code improvements

Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.


## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```
